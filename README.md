# RankSVMLoader

NOTE: This software will load rank support vector machines only, loading support vectors that were pre-trained and pairwise rankings.

Rank Support Vector Machine implementation for loading pre-trained Rank Support Vector Machines. This code was developed directly to support the preference learning toolbox, and load or validate models trained within this software.
